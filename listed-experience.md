# PLEASE NOTE

This list is only partial. Some positions listed are due to third-party outsourcing to these communities in times of need. This means that I was only on their staff for a minimal, specific time due to special events, but that experience in them is still applicable to denote.

All of my experience is verifiable. In the event that you wish to know contact people of the communities, please [send me a message](coikars@outlook.com).

FORMAT
- Person/Group + link to them, where I help them (and whether they are official ‚úÖ, partnered ‚ôæÔ∏è, or noteworthy ‚≠ê), what position I am helping in, what is their approximate audience size, & the date I started/stopped.
Lists are organized from newest to oldest per category.
